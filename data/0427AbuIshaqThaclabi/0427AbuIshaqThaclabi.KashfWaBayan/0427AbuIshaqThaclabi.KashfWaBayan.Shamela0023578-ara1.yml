90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: All the Quranic verses are omitted in Vol 4 (and I
    put a first-level header tag to mark their beginning, in conformity with
    other volumes). In Vol 8, pages 37-41 and the first paragraph in page
    301 are missing. The first paragraph in vol. 7 page 188 is also missing.
    Some very minor inaccuracies in the text like “فأنزلنا” instead of
    “فأنزل” in Vol. 1 P. 202 Line 14 and “ويربي” instead of “ویزکی” in Vol.
    2 P. 383 Line 20.
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 4547, 6777,
    11267, 17980, 19207, 28649
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too long: line numbers 6670, 6760,
    16318, 30218
 Note of the reviewer (Gowaart): deleted editorial sections, added paratext for first paragraph. Deleted footnote markers, manuscript page markers and html tags. There was some overtagging of lines as poetry that were not actually poetry, I have corrected many of these. I have also made rather extensive changes to the header leveling. For the first two suras the actual tafsir of verses has been set apart from other info given related to the sura. To make the text consistent, I have added an extra second level header for all of the other suras, following its introductory remarks. I have added the missing suras in vol. 4 by copying them from the Shia002529Vols file which did include them. They have * separating the verses, which I have left in place. I have done similarly for the noted missing page (in fact only half a page) in vol. 7. There were several more such instances, always the introductory remarks for the sura. I have not replaced the section noted for Vol 8, pages 37-41, as this is in fact an editorial addition of opinions by other exegetes on the topic (it is present in the Shia file however and may be recuperated there if so desired). A specific computational comparison of these two versions may be desirable to check whether any other possible sections may be missing.
