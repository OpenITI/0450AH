90#VERS#COMMENT##: I could not locate the edition used for this edition,
    but it seems to have been structurally similar to the one I did find
    (Thacalibi also tends to be fairly straightforward in his structuring)
    so I used that to get an idea of the general structure of the text and
    then worked on the digital edition.  There are some divergences however:
    in one case the edition I found has more subchapters: bab 2 has  seven
    fasls in edition, but only 5 in digitial edition. On closer comparison
    it turns out the body text  of both editions is the same here, but the
    digital version doesn't subdivide the paragraphs here under fasls.
    Through regex I was also able to tag all the poetry with the mARkdown
    tag.  Aside from the edition issue, the digital edition is actually of
    fairly high quality.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Corrected header tags, most of which did not
    include the whole header or the part of the header which is in parathesis in the
    PDF. 2- A different edition is accessible online:

    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 203, 649, 2201,
    2819, 2888, 3061, 3498
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
