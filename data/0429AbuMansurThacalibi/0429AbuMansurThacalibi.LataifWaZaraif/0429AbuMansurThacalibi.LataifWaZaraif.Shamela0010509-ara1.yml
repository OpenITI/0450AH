90#VERS#COMMENT##: Could not locate a pdf of edition used for the
    digital text (it seems to be a popular printing), so used the Dar al-
    Kutub version instead. Neither of these editions is on Worldcat. Text is
    broadly similar, and structure is mostly identical. However, the Dar al-
    Kutub version is still different: for example it includes eight sections
    between pp. 269-290 (these would be inserted between lines 2620-2621)
    which are entirely absent from the digital text. Other smaller
    differences which I have seen in the text indicate that this may  be due
    to divergent manuscript traditions. Where untagged titles in the digital
    text have the same wording as titles in the Dar al-Kutub  edition I have
    included them in the structure tags, but not where their wording is
    different. I inserted mARkdown tags for poetry through regex.
