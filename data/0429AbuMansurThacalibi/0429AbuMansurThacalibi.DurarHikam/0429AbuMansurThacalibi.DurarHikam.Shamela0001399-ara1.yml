90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Eric van Lit; Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Originally annotated by Eric, validated by Gowaart,
        only minor changes. Sea readme file for some comments by Eric about
        possible further subdivision. This particular edition not found on
        worldcat.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Editorial removed. 2- It is not clear where the
        introduction ends. A title should be added to separate it from the rest of the
        text, or its title (which is added by the typist) should be removed.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
