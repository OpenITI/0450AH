    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Editorial removed. 2- It is not clear where the
    introduction ends. A title should be added to separate it from the rest of the
    text, or its title (which is added by the typist) should be removed.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
