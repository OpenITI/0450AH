90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Gowaart Van Den Bossche
90#VERS#COMMENT##: Actual edition is not on worldcat, but seems to be a
    reprint of the 1958 Cairo edition noted.  Pagination is correct. The
    text is missing the entire introduction (not editorial  but part of the
    author's text), that is pages 3-10 of the edition. Text was pre-tagged
    but I've formatted it further,  sometimes based predominantly on content
    as the layout isn't always as clear in how it subdivides the text.  I've
    added square brackets in section titles where the edition has them. Some
    parts of the text could be tagged with biography tags but this is not
    clearly highlighted in the edition so I have not bothered  to apply it
    in the digital text.
