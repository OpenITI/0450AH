90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is a digitization of a reprint (Qumm 1405) of the
    Ṭabīʿiyyāt
    volumes of the Egyptian edition (ed. Ibrāhīm Madkūr).
    In this file (and the edition it's based on),
    the following fuṣūl are jumbled and partly displaced:
    The end of fann 3 (faṣl 14-15) and beginning of fann 4 (maqāla 1, faṣl 1)
    are found after fann 6 maqāla 5 faṣl 4;
    after faṣl 1 of maqāla 1 of fann 4 follows the rest of maqāla 5 of fann 6.
    Fann 3 faṣl 13 is followed by faṣl 3-4 of fann 4, maqāla 2;
    and then faṣl 2-9 of fann 4, maqāla 1.
    The end of Fann 6 Maqala 5 Fasl 2
    and the end of Fann 6 Maqala 5 Fasl 4
    seem to be missing (or still displaced; also in the edition)
    PV restored the logical order of the text in a separate file, PV0002.
