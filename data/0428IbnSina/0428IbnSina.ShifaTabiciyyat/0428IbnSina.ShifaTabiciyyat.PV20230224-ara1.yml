90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text is based on Rafed0003037Vols,
    which is a digitization of a reprint (Qumm 1405) of the Ṭabīʿiyyāt
    volumes of the Egyptian edition (ed. Ibrāhīm Madkūr).
    In the Rafed file (and the edition it's based on),
    the following fuṣūl are jumbled and partly displaced:
    - FANN3-MAQALA1-FASL14
    - FANN3-MAQALA1-FASL15
    - FANN4-MAQALA1-FASL1
    - FANN6-MAQALA5-FASL3
    - FANN6-MAQALA5-FASL4
    In this file, PV restored the logical order of the text
    (The sections I moved are marked with a `###MOVED###` tag).
