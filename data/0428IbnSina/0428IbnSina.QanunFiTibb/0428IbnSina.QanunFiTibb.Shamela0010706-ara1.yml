90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The text was really awkward to work on since it lacked automatic tags but needed a few tags in each page, while even the beginning of paragraphs do not have tags and are not recognizable. 2- Quite a lot of the sentences (including a part of some of the titles) are typed incompletely (in both Shamela and JK) which looks strange. Either the text is typed very carelessly, or maybe this problem has occurred because of technical issues (like converting the text files or something like that). 3- Some page numbers appear in wrong places. 4- The numbers of the chapters in PageV01P288-299 and PageV01P304-310 are typed one less than the correct numbers. 5- A few lines in PageV01P284-5 and a few lines in PageV03P495-6 are missing. 6- There are some bold words in the text that cannot be considered as headers and should not be tagged since they are mostly important words rather than titles.
