90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text has been tagged, but needs to be reviewed
    and vetted following the new workflow and the missing data to be
    supplied.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Untagged all Juzâ€™ (which has no effect on the structure of the text). Levelling of the headers corrected. 2- Pages 550 onwards is some extra text on the main manuscript, which is not part of this text. This part should be separated. I raised an issue for this. 3- A different edition can be found here: https://archive.org/details/alfirdwsiy2018_gmail_0364
